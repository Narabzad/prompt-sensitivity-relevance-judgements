## Judgment File Naming Convention

Each **relevance judgment file** is named following this pattern: ```[model_name]_[judgment_type]dl[year][participant_id].txt```


Where:
- **`[model_name]`** → The LLM used for judgments (`gpt-4o`, `mistral`, `llama`).
- **`[judgment_type]`** → The type of relevance judgment:
  - `binary` → Binary (0/1) judgments.
  - `graded` → Graded relevance (0-3 scale).
  - `pairwise` → Pairwise comparison between two passages.
- **`dl[year]`** → The dataset year (`dl20` for 2020, `dl21` for 2021).
- **`[participant_id]`** → The ID of the prompt used for the judgment.

### Example Filenames:
- `mistral_graded_dl20_1.txt` → Graded relevance judgments by **Mistral** on **DL 2020**, using prompt **#1**.
- `gpt-4o_binary_dl21_5.txt` → Binary judgments by **GPT-4o** on **DL 2021**, using prompt **#5**.

## Prompt Processing Details

- **Total Prompts:** Initially, there were **32 prompts** in `prompts.json`. 
  - **2 were test prompts** and excluded.
  - **30 prompts** were used in the experiments.
- **Final Processed Prompts:** After filtering, only **12 prompts from humans** and **12 prompts from LLMs** were considered valid for generating judgments.

## Missing Judgments Explanation

- Some judgment files may contain **fewer lines** than others.
- This happens because **some LLMs failed to judge certain passages** or returned incomplete results.
- If a file has missing judgments, it means the **LLM was unable to make a decision** for those cases.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore `data/`** → Contains queries, human labels, and LLM judgments.
2. **Check `prompts.json`** → Defines the prompts used for relevance assessment.
3. **Analyze judgments in `data/judgments/`** → Compare different LLM outputs.
